## Reminder system

Small scale project which prompts a user to sign in/login, if they decide to sign in then their details are stored within the 'users' database which is contained in this repo. Once signed up, then the user is prompted to log on, which in the case that they are successfull will display a dashboard to the user of their reminders. It'll also allow for the user to add or remove reminders as well, more features will be added in the future as this repo gets updated.

Feel free to clone or fork if you can further enhance this code and send a pull request which I'll review.
