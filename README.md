## Reminder system

Medium scale project which prompts a user to sign in/login, if they decide to sign in then their details are stored within the 'userdata' database which is contained in this repo. Once signed up, the users information is then used to generate a unique table in order to retain their reminders (which they can decide to add/remove, this is WIP as of writing this) then the user is prompted to log on, which in the case that they are successful will display a dashboard to the user of their reminders. Additional features will be added in the future as this repo gets updated (probably not as it is for short term).

Feel free to clone or fork if you can further enhance this code and send a pull request which I'll review.
